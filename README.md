# Coxeter-Group-and-Knot-Theory
- This is the coded used for our research project at University of Toronto math department. Our reseach goal was to find connections between knot theory and coxeter diagrams. Knots are created by the pathway that reflected tetrahedrons take. These pathways can be different based on the sequence of the reflection. Our fidning for this reseach project can be found here.
